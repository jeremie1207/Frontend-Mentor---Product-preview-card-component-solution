### What I learned

One of the most important things I learned during this project was how to make images responsive using the <picture> element. This technique allows you to serve different image files depending on the user's screen size, which improves performance and design adaptability across devices.

Hereâ€™s the code I used and am proud of:

```html
<picture class="product__image">
  <source media="(min-width: 620px)" 
          srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg">
  <img src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg" 
       alt="Perfume bottle on a gray background with vegetation">
</picture>
```
